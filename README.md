# Sales Insight: Project Overview
- This project was done under the scenario that a company in India is noticing a decline in sales and the Director wants an insight into the sales of the company
- Tableau Public was used to create two interactive dashboards to analyze both revenue and profit (in rupees)
- MySQL was used to clean and explore the data before being exported into a .csv format and uploaded to Tableau Public
- Link to dashboard: https://public.tableau.com/views/SalesInsightProject2_0/Dashboard-RevenueAnalysis?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
- The data can be further filtered by year and month in the Tableau link

## Revenue Analysis

- The above dashboard breaksdown the revenue of this company by displaying the total revenue, sales quantity, revenue by market, sales quanitity by market, etc.
- The markets that are bringing in the most and least amount of revenue respectively are the Delhi NCR and Bengaluru markets
- The number 1 customer and product respectively are Electricalsara Stores and Product 40
- As seen in the revenue by year graph, revenue has been declining noticeably between mid-2019 and 2020
- Using this information the Director can investigate if something happened in July 2019 to affect either the market or the company itself

## Profit Analysis

- The dashboard above shows the total profit and profit margins of the different markets between 2017 and 2020
- In the profit margin by market graph we can see that Kanpu and especially Bengaluru are failing to make a profit. 
- Interestingly enough Delhi NCR has the greatest revenue but Surat is brining in the most profit compared to the other markets
- This information can be used to see what is being done in the Surat market to drive profit and if those methods can be used to increase profit for underperforming markets

## Insights
Based on the trends visualized in the graphs the following statements can be made:
- Additional research should be done to determine why sales began steadily declining midway in 2019
- Majority of sales are made in the brick and mortar stores
- The Kanpur and Bengaluru markets are losing profits requiring further investigations to see if this can be mitigated. Stratgies can be gained from the top performing markets to assist in increasing profits for the other markets
